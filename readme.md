# What is this?

This small project attempts to automatically detect the games and topics talked about in the Podquistion episodes of the [Jimquistion](https://soundcloud.com/jimquisition) podcast (or rather, the Jimquisition podcasts, as the Spin-Off Doctors are part of the same feed).

Starting with episode 298, the feeds description contains an automatically readable list of games and even timestamps, for each episode. (I'm hoping they're not chaning the format anytime soon or everything breaks down, but oh well).

# A couple notes:

- I have absolutely zero affiliation with the Jimquisition or any of the hosts, this is purely a personal project
- If you have any feedback, accessibility concerns, suggestions, or other issues, create an issue at: [https://github.com/hutattedonmyarm/Plotquisition/issues](https://github.com/hutattedonmyarm/Plotquisition/issues)
- The theme is eyeballed to roughly follow the Jimquisition color pallete, but I did not attempt to recreate the colors to be accurate
- This thing is statically hosted, so basolutely zero personal data is collected. I don't even set any cookies!
- Right now I need to manually run the script to update the site, so sorry if it might lag behind. I'll automate that ASAP
- I'm planning to add the ability to manually add games/override the games and topiclist for every episode, just in case the automation fails. I just haven't gotten around to it yet
